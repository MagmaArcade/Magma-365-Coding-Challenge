take any number x and to get the next number apply the following operation:
even: x = x/2
odd: x = (3 * x) + 1
from any given starting number and follow the series until it reaches 1. For more of a challenge allow users to start from negative numbers.

Example:
input: 11
output: 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
